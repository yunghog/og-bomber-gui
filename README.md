## Features
<p>OG-BOMBER is a unique message spoofing tool unlike any other message spoofing tool. We register the users and store all the
details of the spoof to ensure there is no misuse. To limit the usage there is a quota beyond which you cannot spoof no more
We even keep the record of the victims phone number. There are two type of subscription FREE and PREMIUM. Free users will have a
quota of 200 sms/day and Premium will have unlimited sms. BLACKLISTING service is available for Premium members. You cannot spoof a Blacklisted number, so they are safe. Become a Premium member by <a href="https://www.paypal.me/samartha890?locale.x=en_GB">Donating</a></p>
